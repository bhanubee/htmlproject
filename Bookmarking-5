                “Life is a mirror and will reflect back to the thinker what he thinks into it.” — Ernest Holmes
                
                “Why are you so wary of thought?” said the philosopher. “Thought is the only way we have for organising the world.”
                
                “True. But thought can organise the world so well that you are no longer able to see it.”
                
                To his disciples he later said: “A thought is a screen, not a mirror; that is why you live in a thought envelope, untouched by Reality.”
                
                This delightful tale by Anthony de Mello underscores the message; life is a filter reflecting your innermost thoughts.
                
                People consider their problems to come from outside conditions. They try in vain to change the world surrounding them in hope things will improve. This seldom works because their thoughts are out of alignment.
                
                It was the French-born novelist Anais Nin who said: “You do not see the world as it is. You see it as you are.”
                
                What you hold in mind comes to life irrespective of your preferences.
                
                Life is a mirror; its reflection shines your image back to you.
                
                “External conditions mirror internal conditions, so straightening your room settles internal disorder” affirms authors Charlene Belitz and Meg Lundstrom in, The Power of Flow: Practical Ways to Transform Your Life with Meaningful Coincidence.
                
                If you agree the world is volatile, you will look for evidence to substantiate this.
                
                You might tune into the news and hear of unfortunate incidents that confirm your beliefs</p>

            <p>Discovery: The spark for science
                “Eureka!” or “aha!” moments
                may not happen frequently, but
                they are often experiences that
                drive science and scientists. For
                a scientist, every day holds the
                possibility of discovery—of coming up with a brand new idea or
                of observing something that no
                one has ever seen before. Vast
                bodies of knowledge have yet to be built and many of the most basic questions about
                the universe have yet to be answered:</p>

            <h2>Technical life</h2>
            <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lD4pDdPELUs/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="" weight="200" height="200">
            <p>The Technology Life Cycle*, shown in figure 1 below, illustrates the typical
                 life cycle of an innovation, from conception to decline. It helps you understand 
                 the commercial gain that you may be able to get from a new product, and predict
                  when you'll be able to generate significant profits from it.In phase one, the company invests in internal research and development of a new product, and in phase two, we see its initial launch and early sales. In phase three, the product is penetrating the market and competition is beginning to emerge, while, in the final stage, the product is declining as it starts to become obsolete.

                  You can see this with the innovation behind the technology of Amazon's Kindle® e-reader. It is a product that incurred significant research and development costs. But, because of the nature of the technology, Amazon's competitors were able to respond quickly.
                  
                  Because Amazon knows that patents will only protect its product for so long, it had to come up with a strategy to generate follow-on revenue. This involved launching a range of devices, including e-readers with touch-sensitive screens, a tablet computer with a color display, reader apps, and a lower-priced model.
                  
                  Note:
                  Sometimes, people compare the Technology Life Cycle to the Gartner Hype Cycle, developed by Gartner, Inc. and Jackie Fenn, or the Product Diffusion Curve, which encourages you to target different customer groups at different stages of a product's life.
                  
                  Explore these different models to see which one is most useful to you.
                  
                  Applying the Technology Life Cycle
                  How you work with this model depends on where your product is in its life cycle.
                  
                  Phase 1: Research and Development
                  The research and development stage is the riskiest of the four stages. Here, you invest time, money and resources into a technology that may or may not work out.
                  
                  To maximize the opportunities in this phase, identify your Critical Success Factors and make sure that your investments are aligned. For each project or product, estimate the market size to ensure that there's a big enough customer base for investment to be worthwhile.
                  
                  Make sure that the product has a clear and sustainable USP, and that it builds upon one of your organization's core competencies, or some other unique resource such as a patent – that way, it's hard for competitors to copy.
                  
                  Finally, consider using business experiments and minimum viable products to test your ideas quickly, so that you develop something that fully meets customers' real needs.

            <h2>Agricuiture is form of life cycle</h2>
            <img src="https://image3.slideserve.com/6589351/agriculture-n.jpg" alt=""wight="150" height="150">
            <p>The agricultural cycle is the annual cycle of activities related to the 
                growth and harvest of a crop (plant). These activities include loosening 
                the soil, seeding, special watering, moving plants when they grow bigger,
                and harvesting, among others. Without these activities, a crop cannot be grown.
                  The main steps for agricultural practices include preparation of soil, sowing,
                   adding manure and fertilizers, irrigation, harvesting and storage.
                   In temperate and tropical areas rainfall and snowfall are the main
                    suppliers of irrigation water, but in dry places with unfavourable
                    conditions, groundwater serves as an essential source. Groundwater
                     collects in basins made up of gravel and aquifers, which are water
                     -holding rocks. Dams also act as an essential distributive source of
                      irrigation water. Underground wells also play an important role in
                       storing water for irrigation, specifically in America, and Arizona,
                        in particular. Water and debris from streams filled by water accumulated
                         during storms also collect into underground basins. There are two types
                          of irrigation techniques: spray irrigation and drip irrigation. Drip irrigation
                           is regarded as more efficient as less water evaporates than in spray
                            irrigation.</p>

            <p>Do you know someone who has a low opinion of himself? Perhaps someone
                who consistently thinks she is an under-performer and not worthy of praise
                or compliments? It could be that person is suffering from low self-esteem.
                Simply put, your level of self-esteem is how you think about yourself, how
                you see yourself.
                Some people have an inflated image of their reality. Then there are those
                who have a good grip on who they are, and their range of abilities and selfworth.
                 Unfortunately, there are also those people who suffer from a
                debilitating condition involving their self-beliefs that can actually lead to a
                shortened lifespan and physical health problems that arise from stress. 
                The definition of low self-esteem is simple – a feeling of unworthy,dangerous
                 cycle where continued negative self-beliefs begin to create an
                unconscious pattern of behavior that reinforces those thoughts in that
                person's mind. They say to themselves, "See, my behavior is proof that I am
                incompetent. Therefore, I am right to believe that I am unworthy and
                incapable." The beliefs get stronger, and the thought-pattern continues.</p>
